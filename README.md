# Eye-Controlled-Mouse-A-Gaze-Based-Interface
This innovative project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to enable users to control their computer mouse using only their eyes. By analyzing real-time video feeds from a webcam, the system accurately tracks eye movements and translates them into precise mouse cursor movements and clicks.
